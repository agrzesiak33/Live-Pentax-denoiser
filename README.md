# Live-Pentax-denoiser

Not yet started yet but it will take live input from my Pentax K3 and apply the discrete fourier transform to the image, identify the noise in the image and remove it.  The frame rate will be low since the run time of the algorithm is n^3 but I'm hoping to utilize my graphics card to minimize the time it takes to compute the DFT image.
